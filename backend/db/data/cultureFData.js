    summary: 'Who\'d have thought a story by Stephen King, more over a short story, would do so well both commercially and critically? Well, this is what you get when you get Frank Darabont to direct a movie with Morgan Freeman in it. The movie chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man\'s unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red.

Ben Affleck and Matt Damon\'s screenwriting debut, which they co-won an Oscar for. If only Titanic did not completely eclipse this movie in 1997, this movie would have won much more than the 4 academy awards than it did. It\'s touching tale of a wayward young man who struggles to find his identity, living in a world where he can solve any problem, except the one brewing deep within himself, until one day he meets his soulmate who opens his mind and his heart.',

    summary: 'It could be said that Forrest Gump is the definitive American movie. After all, it\'s historical, patriotic and it\'s got a dunce as the hero. A loving and friendly dunce, of course, played by Tom Hanks. Nominated for 13 Oscars and winning six, including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor, "Gump" captured the imagination with its mix of comedy, drama, and touching on issues like AIDS and war, while managing to maintain a poignant love story at its big budget core. It charts the life of Forrest, a simple man who inadvertently finds himself in heroic situations. Devoted to his Ma (by far the weakest link of the movie), he does everything from teach Elvis how to move his hips to running the length and breadth of America. He meets some people along the way, like Sinise\'s gruff Captain Dan during Vietnam, but really, and perhaps this is why audiences took to it, Forrest does everything for his one true love: the experimental, sad, and ultimately broken Jenny (Wright-Penn). Whether you like it or not really comes down to one thing: how much sentimentality can you take? Because despite the excellent performances and extravagant scale, Zemeckis has his finger well and truly on the nostalgia button. And then there\'s the affirmation of the American Dream: isn\'t it great that even a dolt, as long as he\'s kind and loving, can make it in the fantastic US of A?',

    summary: 'Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault to the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film\s cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I\'ve seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I\'ll be the first in line to see the finished product.',

    summary: 'Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts). Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; "a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused...". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance. Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside. As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day. The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms - not that you\'d be able to guess from the tone of this film). The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes\' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well. Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film. All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort.',

    image: 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMzQyNjA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTU2NTY3._V1_.jpg',
    summary: 'Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at "the mile" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly. A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan. It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie\'s considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation. All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.',

    summary: 'Let\'s ignore the advice and talk about "Fight Club". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher\'s cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky \'cutting edge\' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing. This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.',

    summary: 'Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler\'s List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself. The feelings I experienced while viewing this film are almost indescribable. The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes. I am an avid fan in World War II history but more specifically Holocaust history. It is my belief that humanity has a huge lesson to be learned from cowardly acts such as the Holocaust, and this movie has an uncanny way of helping pass the message along. This film shows human compassion even in the darkest of times. I don\'t think my eyes were dry at all during the movie-I found it so deeply moving. My rating of 10/10 originates from both the acting as well as the harrowing observation of humanity and the messages conveyed. The movie will have a place not only on my shelf but also in my heart. Truly one of Spielberg\'s finest works.',

    summary: 'A fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn\'t seen in a long, long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character\'s name sounds like Aldo Ray and I\'m sure that\'s no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970\'s sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino\'s trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognisable bits of pop culture. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.',

    summary: 'Sure it\'s outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino\'s movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker? Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the \'60s and \'70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It\'s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros\' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the \'Carrie\' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride\'s gory face as she\s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride \'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai\' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?	This film\'s a sampling of the Tarantino \'fury,\' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue.',

    summary: 'Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I\'m contradicting myself? Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it\'s film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock\'s influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy\'s shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I\'m not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese\'s ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn\'t catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else\'s shoes entirely during the second viewing. Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.',

    summary: 'A captivating mix Of contemporary and retro aesthetics, Drive is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. \'Drive\' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.',

    summary: '"A Beautiful Mind" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director. Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness. This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient. Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Crowe and cast, this film succeeds on every level.',

    summary: 'There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year\'s Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company\'s go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory. Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre. Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not "well" in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.',

    summary: 'Ghostbusters was an incredibly huge smash hit on its original release back in `84 and its not hard to see why - its a funny, exciting and imaginative thrill ride. There is a lot to like about ghostbusters, like bill Murrays constant and always funny wise cracks, the films constant shift from a light hearted comedy to intense ghost busting thriller and of course, the technically flawless attack of the marsh mallow man that is probably one of my favorite parts of this film. In this day and age of computer generated fx wizardry the completely analogue special effects still look great ( especially the stay puft marsh mallow man , its rampage through the city looks incredibly real ! ) and the film it self is still better and more imaginative than a lot of event movies you will find in a cinema near you today. And to top it all off Ghostbusters is one of the few films out there that actually had worthy TV spin off that was the "real Ghostbusters", a cartoon that i loved as a kid. Ghostbusters is a film that truly deserves its iconic status.',

    summary: 'The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys\' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren\'t many...it\'s the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students\' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that\'s just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon\'s ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire. Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we\'d had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of "seizing the day". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless "Introduction to Poetry" from the time honored Pritchard textbook! The \"Dead Poets Society\", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father\'s clearly defined expectations for his son\'s life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist). It\'s an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone. This is a must-see movie, especially if you\'re a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn\'t quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only \"Carpe Diem", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.',

    summary: 'Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.',

    title: 'Napoleon Dynamite',

    summary: 'If you like dry or dark humor, you should get a big kick out of this movie. I know I did. If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too. The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are all hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an "original." I didn\'t know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I\'ve ever seen in other films. Even though he\'s pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he\'s fun to watch and hear throughout the movie. Suffice to say "Napoleon" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character\'s faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes, like the bimbo, prettiest girl in school running for class president , and her stupid, macho boyfriend, but most of the people were pretty unique. If you like absurd humor, this is your cup of tea, and you don\'t have to be a teen to enjoy this. Hey, I\'m old enough to be Napoleon\'s grandfather and I laughed my butt off from the beginning to the end of this unconventional film.',

    summary: 'This isn\'t just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film.',

    title: 'Pan\'s Labyrinth',

    summary: 'Set during Franco\'s mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro\'s Pan\'s Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents. Though the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology. Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero). Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life. Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan\'s Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.',

    summary: 'The Truman Show epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn\'t know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions. Taking this entirely original concept, writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus, the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film\'s brilliance. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality, particularly in the movie\'s final sequence. This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy, drama, strong character development, atmosphere, originality, superb visuals, a superb score, tight writing, raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition.',

    year: 2019,
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/lni2ShH.jpg',
    summary: 'Suffice to say, this film is destined to be a perennial.The stand-out performance is Laura Dern\'s. As Jo, Saoirse Ronan is more the glue holding the narrative together, generously supporting all the others. Even the things worthy of criticism enhance the entertainment value. The poverty of the wartime March family--indeed the entire Civil War aspect of the story-- is played down. Costumes and interiors are affluent, bordering on Gilded Age. Like many other period films, there are far too many candles and oil lamps lit in the daytime with sun streaming in the windows. This is LITTLE WOMEN seen through the prism of contemporary gender politics, and that is okay by me!',

    summary: '"As you wish..." "Inconceivable!" "My name is Inigo Montoya..." This film is everything. From its opening scenes of the young boy being read a story by his kindly Grandfather to the romance, action, adventure and fun of the fairy tale. The Princess bride tells the tale of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love, Westley (Elwes) who become separated through the course of an unfortunate event involving some pirates. Westley\'s destiny is to rescue Buttercup from the clutches of an evil Prince so that they might be together again. Yet he\'s not bargained on some of the wonderful characters that he will meet (and befriend) along the way... This film is so deliciously acted, made and written that it is a treat to watch.I\'ve lost count of how many times I\'ve seen it now. But every time I still gain the same enormous amount of pleasure from watching it. A movie that is a delight for the young and just as much fun for everyone else. The actors are all superb in their roles (\'perfect casting\' does not come close to describing it!) A young Cary Elwes is suitably dashing as our cocky hero (check out the sword fighting!)and Robin Wright is good as the beautiful Buttercup. Mandy Patinkin is great as the vengeful Inigo Montoya who utters that famous "you killed my father. prepare to die" line. Everyone else gives there all, including Christoper Guest, Chris Sarandon (as the main villian), Wallace Shawn, the late Andre The Giant,Mel Smith, and Billy Crystal. Despite the film being over 30 years old, it\'s widely reference in pop culture, due to the humour and sly jokes that are carefully sprinkled in the movie, making them as sharp today as they were back in 1987.',

    summary:'Some may consider it controversial that Captain Marvel makes it onto our list of movies to watch, given the uninspiring reviews online, but -unpopular opinion- I think the movie carries depth beyond the MCU. It\'s torn the MCU fandomand frankly, hasn\'t been recieved as well as expected for unwarranted reasons. Give Brie Larson a chance! Larson\'s performance portaying a hyped, and well-loved character in the MCU is always going to be met by harsh critics. Captain Marvel is afterall, a much anticipated character, with complicated origin story. There was a lot to fit into this movie, and simply not enough time for the audience to adjust. The installment dates back to the 90\'s, where the audience is introduced to Carol Danvers and a much younger Nick Fury. What an introduction! Danvers becomes one of the universe\'s most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. Lot\'s of 90\'s pop culture references, music, and grundge fashion- a welcoming wave of nostaligia washed over me while watching Carol kick ass. Ignoring the crituque of weeding through social justice messages, this was a fun movie, with a leading lady and 0 love interests- easily passing the bechtel test. We see Carol eventually tipping the scales for our Heros in the fight to save the worlds against Thanos',

    summary: 'Quite possibly the biggest crossover in cinematic history! What the Russo brothers have a achieved in the last decade is nothing short of spectacular. Endgame takes off where Infinity War left us. And it left us utterly devastated and wondering how our hroes could could possibly get out of this mess. We wondered how the story would go on, what would be the end of Thanos. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this wasn\'t not the case for Endgame. Whatever your expectations were, you probably found the movie has far exceeded them. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? Endgame was the finale of phase one and two of the MCU\'s reimagining of our favourate heroes. Avengers Endgame is a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye who are at the center of the devastating events unravelling. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team- shoutout ot my fave, Ant Man! not just providing welll-executed comedic relief, but a plot device to save and undo what Thanos has done. Everyone\'s concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. In true Marvel fashion, it gives a good message about being a hero and what it means to be a family.',
