So all hail the lovely Esters, on a quiet side street, for its slick contemporary interior and impeccable modern coffee. Owners Nia Burr and Jack Lloyd-Jones met working at Fernandez & Wells before taking over the reins at this tucked-away little gem. Go for its imaginative ever-changing menu (French toast with fragolina grapes and whipped ricotta, for example) and its magnificent cakes.',

Greasy spoons have long been a central part of life in the capital and nowhere keeps the flame burning better than the Regency Café near Tate Britain. Think classic white-tiled walls and formica tables, with a roaring tea-urn. Grab yourself a spot in amongst the dust-covered labourers and tuck into sausages, eggs and chips while owner Claudia Perotti barks out the orders in her booming baritone. They don’t, it probably goes without saying, do single-estate pour-over.',
