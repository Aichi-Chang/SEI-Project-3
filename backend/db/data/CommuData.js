    text: 'It’s easy sometimes to forget that London’s café culture wasn’t invented in 2007 by an influx of avocado-smashing Aussies. Greasy spoons have long been a central part of life in the capital and nowhere keeps the flame burning better than the Regency Café near Tate Britain. Think classic white-tiled walls and formica tables, with a roaring tea-urn. Grab yourself a spot in amongst the dust-covered labourers and tuck into sausages, eggs and chips while owner Claudia Perotti barks out the orders in her booming baritone. They don’t, it probably goes without saying, do single-estate pour-over.',

    text: 'The soft-boiled eggs come in little hand-knitted hats at this Hampstead café, perfectly located in the heart of the village. The interior is a lovely white box with stripped back retro-industrial fittings and the clientele is refreshingly varied for the neighbourhood: guys in high-vis as well as the handbag brigade. Prep yourself for a stomp on the Heath with smashed avocado and goat’s cheese on toasted sourdough and a Square Mile flat white at a hidden-away corner table.',

    text: 'Up on its main thoroughfare, Church Street, Stokie’s cafes are mostly depressingly behind the curve: all huge frothing cappuccinos and heavy bought-in cakes. So all hail the lovely Esters, on a quiet side street, for its slick contemporary interior and impeccable modern coffee. Owners Nia Burr and Jack Lloyd-Jones met working at Fernandez & Wells before taking over the reins at this tucked-away little gem. Go for its imaginative ever-changing menu (French toast with fragolina grapes and whipped ricotta, for example) and its magnificent cakes.',

    text: 'Following on from their cult Brunswick East café, Aussie sisters Natasha Bacon and Shaunae England have opened a second site, Brunswick East Bakehouse in Hackney Downs Studios, and it might just be – whisper it – an improvement on the original. Here, they are blessed with simpatico neighbours (greenery from plant shop Kill the Closest Snake fill the windows of the light-filled shared space), and, crucially, there’s room for their very own bread oven. And what wonders they have worked with it! The breakfast bruschetta is a slab of sourdough heaving with avocado, basil and cashew cream, and the signature chili poached eggs come on a flatbread made to order. The cake counter heaves with delights like orange and cardamom scrolls and blueberry and coconut friands. The Coffee is Square Mile. And the whole place buzzes with the feel of A Good Thing.',

    text: 'Aware that Peckham’s not exactly a neighbourhood awash with cash, owner Maddy Beevers has put the emphasis very much on affordability at this lovely plywood-decked neighbourhood café; a cup of tea costs a quid and you can pick up a bowl of their flavour-packed fattoush for just £3.50. There’s a pay it forward scheme, which allows you to buy a drink for someone less able to afford it at half price (she’ll pick up the other half). And there’s a clothes swap in the back. The coffee is sourced from Café Feminino, a women farmers’ collective in Peru. And everything about the place is sunny and lovely.',

If you’re eating in, mix your dumplings with more substantial plates such as curry fish balls, garlic basil wings and rice pots, and finish off with some signature Hong Kong egg tarts.',

With Frank\'s also came Bold Tendencies, an annual sculpture show on top of the same car park, which firmly established Peckham as a thriving site on London\'s art scene. The lower levels have also hosted classical concerts, including the Proms (apparently the concrete ceilings are excellent for acoustics). On the ground floor is the retro Peckhamplex cinema; scruffy but locally loved, it sells tickets for £4.99 – to any film, all day long.',
