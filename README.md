### üö© Project-3 - The Vault (Group) ###

The third project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application**. This project was completed in a team of 4 within a week.

The vault is an online lifestyle magazine with four different themes: second-hand clothes swap, popular locations, hot topics, and editor-selected music album, films, and book recommendations. Users will be able to register to the site. On different pages, logged in users can leave or delete comments under the articles.

### :rocket: Get Started ###

* Clone or download the repo
* `npm init`
* Run `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db` if you are using MacOS Catalina. Otherwise run `mongod`
* `npm run seed` for seeding
* `npm run serve:back` to run back-end
* `npm run serve:front` to run front-end


### üìù Brief ###

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* A **working app** hosted on the internet
