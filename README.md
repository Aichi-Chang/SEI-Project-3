### üö© Project-3 - The Vault (Group) ###

The third project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application**. This project was completed in a team of 4 within a week.

The vault is an online lifestyle magazine with four different themes: second-hand clothes swap, popular locations, hot topics, and editor-selected music album, films, and book recommendations. Users will be able to register to the site. On different pages, logged in users can leave comments under the articles.

### :rocket: Get Started ###

* Clone or download the repo
* `npm init`
* Run `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db` if you are using MacOS Catalina. Otherwise run `mongod`
* `npm run seed` for seeding
* `npm run serve:back` to run back end
* `npm run serve:front` to run front end


### üìù Brief ###

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back end and front end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.


### üïπ Technologies used ###

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Node
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git
* GitHub
* React and React extensions
* Webpack
* Tachyons
* Yarn
* Babel
* Insomnia
* Python 3
* Django
* Heroku


### ‚úîÔ∏è Approach Taken ###

#### Project plan

| Time      | Tasks         |
| ------------- |-------------|
| **1 day**    |  Ideas research, Team brief, planning project days   |
| **2  days**     |  Backend Initial set up, UX design first edition  |
| **2 days**  | Frontend set up, UX design complete      |
| **1 day**  | Styling and Troubleshooting With Instructor   |
| **1 day** | Bug fixing, final polishing  |
| **1/2 day** | Deployment     |


#### Back end

- Set up the project model and todos model, add the user model using JSON Web Token. Build views, serializers, and URLs. Create tables and data with PostgreSQL.
- Hook the project files up with admin and test on the Django REST framework. Also, test the routes on Insomnia.

- Add extra features, eg. tags models and serializers. Adjust the views for different end-points.
- Override the query set so that different users could only access the correct inbox given the various privacy settings.
- final routes test on Insomnia and seed the database onto Fixtures.

#### Front end

- Get brief and design files from other team mate, discuss protential features and user interface.
- Set up the front end instructure. Connect the back end to the Front end. 
- The style of the project aimed for clean and easy to use.

- Have inbox and other folders for different purposes. The folders are set up as the tags in the backend. When user create project, they will be able to classfy them. 
- Use SVG files, to make the images look sharp at any dimension with tiny file sizes.


### ü§ó Wins ###

- I decided to complete this project on my own as we had only learned Python and Django a week prior to completing the project. It was difficult while completing it, as it showed loopholes in my knowledge but this project also helped me gain a better understanding.
- Rather than using the front end filter function. I have learned how to override the back end's query set to limit different user's access and successfully applied it to the project. 
  
   ```python
  class TodoListView(APIView):

    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, )

    def get(self, _request):
        serialized_todos = PopulatedTodoSerializer(self.get_queryset(), many=True)
        return Response(serialized_todos.data)

    def get_queryset(self):
        user = self.request.user
        return Todo.objects.filter(owner=user.id)
    ```

- Completed the front end using React Hooks. It makes the code cleaner and easier to understand for other developers.
- It was a great experience working with a UX designer. It helped me to see our project from a different angle.

### üßê Chanllenges ###

- Add the tags feature halfway on the project, and it was difficult to rewrite the code and try to cover every corner that has got affected by it.
```python
class Tag(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField(max_length=20)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.name}'


class Project(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    note = models.TextField()
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='projects', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag, related_name='projects', blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.title}: {self.note}, {self.owner}'
```
```python
  class TagSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

      class Meta:
          model = Tag
          fields = ('id', 'name', 'projects')
  
  class ProjectSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): 

    class Meta:
        model = Project
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'note', 'tags', 'owner', 'todos', 'created_at')
        extra_kwargs = {'todos': {'required': False}, 'tags': {'required': False}}

  class PopulatedProjectSerializer(ProjectSerializer): 

    owner = OwnerSerializer() 
    tags = TagSerializer(many=True)
    todos = TodoSerializer(many=True)

  class PopulatedTagSerializer(TagSerializer):

    projects = ProjectSerializer(many=True)

```

- Try to learn new features whilst building the project. I spent a lot of time reading through the documentation and other developer's questions on Stack Overflow. It was good practice for me, but couldn't manage to complete them all on time.
- Outside of the assigned time frame, I have used some extra time for bug fixing. So time management is important.


### üîÆ Potential future features ###

- React Calender
- React Drag and Drop
- Link the edit and tick completed function form the back end to the front end. And creat the user interfaces for it.
