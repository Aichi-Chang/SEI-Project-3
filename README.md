### üö© Project-3 - The Vault (Group) ###

The third project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application**. This project was completed in a team of 4 within a week.

The vault is an online lifestyle magazine with four different themes: second-hand clothing swap, popular locations, hot topics, and editor-selected music album, films, and book recommendations. Users will be able to register to the site. On different pages, logged in users can leave or delete comments under the articles. 

Visit the site here - [The Vault](https://project-3-the-vault.herokuapp.com/), or you can also find the GitHub repo - [GitHub](https://github.com/Aichi-Chang/The-Vault)

### :rocket: Get Started ###

* Clone or download the repo
* `npm init`
* Run `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db` if you are using MacOS Catalina. Otherwise run `mongod`
* `npm run seed` for seeding
* `npm run serve:back` to run back-end
* `npm run serve:front` to run front-end


### üìù Brief ###

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* A **working app** hosted on the internet


### üïπ Technologies used ###

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* MongoDB & Mongoose
* Node.js
* Express
* React and React extensions
* Webpack
* Bulma
* Babel
* Insomnia
* Heroku
* Git
* GitHub


### ‚úîÔ∏è Approach Taken ###

#### Project plan

| Time      | Tasks         |
| ------------- |-------------|
| **1 day**    |  Ideas research, team brief, planning project days   |
| **2  days**     |  Backend initial set up, seeding completed  |
| **2 days**  | Frontend set up,  backend feature adjust    |
| **1 day**  | Styling and troubleshooting with instructor   |
| **1 day** | Bug fixing, final polishing  |
| **1/2 day** | Deployment     |

#### Back end
- As we have four theme for our app and they all require deifferent schema, so we set up several different models plus one user model in our back-end.
- For the users, we have add the likes field, so we will be able to retrieve the articles liked by user.
```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ 
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, 
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true  }, 
  likes: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'users' }]
}, {
  timestamps: true, 
  toJSON: { 
    transform(doc, json) {
      return { 
        username: json.username,
        id: json._id,
        likes: json.likes 
      }
    }
  }
})
```

- In user function, we have also created ***GET*** and ***PUT*** function for users' saved articles.
```js
// find user liked articles
function retrieveLikes(req, res) {
  User
    .findOne({ _id: req.params.userId })
    .then(user => {
      if (!user) res.status(404).json({ message: 'User Not Found' })
      return res.status(200).json(user)
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}


// edit user liked articles
function updateLikes(req, res) {
  req.body.user = req.currentUser
  User
    .findOne({ _id: req.params.userId })
    .then(user => {
      if (!user) res.status(404).json({ message: 'User Not Found' })
      user.likes.push(req.body)
      
      res.status(201).json(user)
      return user.save()
    })
    
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}
```

- As the magazine has a second-hand clothing swap page, we allow user to ***POST***, ***PUT*** and ***DELETE*** their items on the clothing page. And other user will be able to leave comments below for a swap.
```js
// ************************ clothing ************************
router.route('/clothing')
  .get(clothingFunc.index)
  .post(secureRoute, clothingFunc.create)

router.route('/clothing/:id')
  .get(clothingFunc.show)
  .put(secureRoute, clothingFunc.update)
  .delete(secureRoute, clothingFunc.remove)

router.route('/clothing/:id/comments')
  .post(secureRoute, clothingFunc.createComment)

router.route('/clothing/:id/comments/:commentId')
  .delete(secureRoute, clothingFunc.removeComment)

```

#### Front end

- For this project, we have used React Hooks. It makes the code cleaner and easier to read. 

- We used the Uber's React Map GL package for Mapbox for our community page, it has the popup function so user will be able to check the information quickly.

- I wrote the comment feature for the project. As we have several pages require this feature, I have pulled the comment form itself out to a common component, but pass a props ***updateData*** back to setData, so once user left a comment, it will push to our single article's comment array and get rendered.

***single article component***

The initial state
```js
const [data, setData] = useState( { comments: [] })
```
The original data remains the same, but the updateData will set the comments into our data
```js
  <CommentForm 
    url={`/api/clothing/${props.match.params.id}/comments`}
    updateData={setData}
    data={data}
  />
```
All comment will get rendered here
``` js
  <div className='columns'>
    <div className='column'>
      {data.comments.map((comment) => 
        <div className="is-half" 
          key={comment._id} > 
          <div>{comment.content}</div>
          <br />
          <button className="delete" id={comment._id} onClick={(e) => handleDelete(e)}></button> 
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  </div> 
```

***comment form component***

The initial state
```js
const CommentForm = ({ url, updateData, data }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState('')
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({
    errors: []
  })
```
submit the form to our back-end, pass back the newData with comments and set form content to none.
```js
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    axios.post( url , { content: formData }, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${Auth.getToken()}` }
    })
      .then(response => {
        const newData = { ...data }
        newData.comments = response.data 
        updateData(newData)
        setFormData('')
      })
      .catch(err => setErrors({ ...err, errors: err.data }))
  }
```


### ü§ó Wins ###

- Most back-end features are completed. After testing it on Insomnia, we can bascally get all the correct data coming back from our API. 
- The comment feature is running well but still need some style.
- As the person created the main repository on Github, I also help other teammates for their git issues. eg. merge branches, conflits, git push...
